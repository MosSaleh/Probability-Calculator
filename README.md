# Probability-Calculator
Project based on freecodecamp project list. 
There is a hat class takes arguments of balls of differing quantity and colors. There is also a draw method which removes a number of balls at random.
This is later used for the 'experiment' function outside of the class which takes a certain instance of the class, which color balls and how many you want for the probability calculation, how many balls are to be drawn, and the number of times you run the experiment.
The function includes, the repetition of the draw method which is done by making a deep copy of the specific instance of the given hat.
Final probability is given as M (how many times the desired outcome happens) divided by N (number of times you run the experiment)
